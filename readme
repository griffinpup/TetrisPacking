The graph and error are outputted every time there is a failure, and when the solution is found.
In order to reproduce these results unzip the code and run solve.out as so.

./solve.out

In order to compile the code, simply run

make

This will create a solve.out file if one does not already exist.  node.h and node.cpp define
the node class.  test.cpp is the driver to the solution, and recursive_place contains the
majority of the logic.  shape.h and shape.cpp contain methods for building each indifidual shape.
